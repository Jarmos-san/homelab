# My Personal Home Server

This repository holds the contents for setting up a personal [Home Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_server). Do note, the project is still work-in-progress & nothing here is set in stone!

That said, for now following are the necessary I need for the server:

1. [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv) to automate downloading my favourite animes & TV shows.
2. [Prowlarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/prowlarr) for managing the indexes all at one place.
3. [Radarr](https://radarr.video) to automate downloading of my favourite movies whenever they're available.
4. [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio) to automate downloading of my favourite songs whenever available
5. [Jeyllfin](https://jellyfin.org) for managing all the media downloaded using the aforementioned tools.
6. [Heimdall](https://heimdall.site) for managing the containerised applications within the browser.
7. [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) to block ads on the whole network.
8. [Transmission BitTorrent Client](https://transmissionbt.com) to download the actual torrent files.

...more such tools will be added to the list as & when the need arises!
